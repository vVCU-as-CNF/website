# Life cycle management of automotive data functions in MEC infrastructures

### Mikel Seron, Angel Martin & Gorka Velez

## Abstract

Cars capture and generate huge volumes of data in real-time, including the driving dynamics, the environment, and the driver and passengers' activities. With the proliferation of Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) applications, the value of vehicle data is getting higher for the automotive industry as it is not limited to onboard systems and services. This paper proposes an architecture that exploits Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) technology of 5G networks to enable data monetisation. It employs a virtualisation framework that instantiates on consumer demand pipelines that process data samples according to Service Level Agreement (SLA) policies, licensing terms and Region Of Interest (ROI) clusters with a privacy-centric design. In addition, the aspects that need to be considered when creating a data marketplace for the automotive sector are identified while highlighting the design features that go beyond the current scientific and market solutions.
