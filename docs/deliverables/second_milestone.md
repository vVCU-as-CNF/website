# Second Milestone

### Presentation of the Lifecycle Architecture.

## Elaboration phase

The purpose is to establish the baseline of the architecture of the system and provide a stable basis for the bulk of the development effort in the next phase.

​	Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements.

​	Design, implement, validate, and establish the baseline for the architecture. Design, implement, and test a skeleton structure of the 	system. 

​	Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates.

## Requirements Elicitation

Describe the requirements of system users, customers and other stakeholders 

1. Requirements gathering

   ​		Sources of information including interviews, questionnaires, user observation, workshops, brainstorming, etc.

2. Functional requirements

   ​		What the system is supposed to accomplish, for example: business Rules, administrative functions, authentication and authorization levels, reporting, historical data, or Regulatory Requirements. 

3. Context and State of The Art (SOA)

   ​		How the system is expected to be used and what has been done in this context

4. Actors

   ​		Describe the target users in your system.

5. Use cases

   ​		Describe the interaction between users and the system to achieve specific goals. Tip: organize the use cases by packages.

6. Non-functional requirements

   ​		Describe how the system works (while functional requirements describe what the system should do), for example: performance (e.g., response time, capacity , availability , recoverability, maintainability , security , data integrity , usability, or interoperability.

## Goals

For this 10 minute presentation each team must prepare:

- Present a more detailed State-of-Art 
    - Requirements elicitation
    - Define goals State of the art (improved: related work + technologies) Collect information: documents, interviews

- Functional and non-functional requirements
    - Actors, uses cases and other

- System Architecture
    - Skeleton structure of the system

- Design mock-ups as soon as possible
