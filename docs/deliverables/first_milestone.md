# First Milestone

### Presentation of the Lifecycle Objectives and Calendar for the Project.

## Inception phase

Inception is about understanding the project scope and objectives

Understand what to build. Determine an overall vision, including the scope of the system and its boundaries. Identify the stakeholders: who is interested in this system and what are their success criteria?

Identify key system functionality. Decide which requirements are most critical.

Determine at least one possible solution. Assess whether the vision is technically feasible. This may involve identifying a candidate high-level architecture or doing technical prototypes, or both.

Understand the high-level estimate for cost, schedule, and risks associated with the project.
