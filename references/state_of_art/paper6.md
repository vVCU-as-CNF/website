# A Design of MANO System for Cloud Native Infrastructure

### Jangwon Lee & Younghan Kim

## Abstract

Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) usually have been running as software on Virtual Machine (VMs) in cloud infrastructure. However, as container technologies are growing in the cloud area, containerization of VNFs is required, and updated NFV reference architecture is under development in European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and hybrid NFV system which support both of VMs and containers are required. In this paper, we solve two problems: Kubernetes, where only a few features are used to provide container based VNFs, and administrator challenges due to different resource models used in each infrastructure. With the proposed architecture and new resource models that fully utilize Kubernetes, administrators can obtain a single hybrid MANO system and management speed with more readable and friendly descriptors. For these improved solutions, we propose through Kubernetes, Operator Framework, and KubeVirt.
