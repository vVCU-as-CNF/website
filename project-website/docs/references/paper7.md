## Abstract

Collaborative driving can significantly reduce the computation offloading from autonomous vehicles (AVs) to edge computing devices (ECDs) and the computation cost of each AV. However, the frequent information exchanges between AVs for determining the members in each collaborative group will consume a lot of time and resources. In addition, since AVs have different computing capabilities and costs, the collaboration types of the AVs in each group and the distribution of the AVs in different collaborative groups directly affect the performance of the cooperative driving. Therefore, how to develop an efficient collaborative autonomous driving scheme to minimize the cost for completing the driving process becomes a new challenge. To this end, we regard collaboration as a service and propose a digital twins (DT)-based scheme to facilitate the collaborative and distributed autonomous driving. Specifically, we first design the DT for each AV and develop a DT-enabled architecture to help AVs make the collaborative driving decisions in the virtual networks. With this architecture, an auction game-based collaborative driving mechanism (AG-CDM) is then designed to decide the head DT and the tail DT of each group. After that, by considering the computation cost and the transmission cost of each group, a coalition game-based distributed driving mechanism (CG-DDM) is developed to decide the optimal group distribution for minimizing the driving cost of each DT. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can converge to a Nash stable collaborative and distributed structure and can minimize the autonomous driving cost of each AV.
