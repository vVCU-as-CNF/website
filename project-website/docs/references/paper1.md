# A roadside and cloud-based vehicular communications framework for the provision of C-ITS services

## Abstract

The road infrastructure plays a vital role in the support and development of the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) paradigm. Roadside units (RSUs), equipped with vehicular communications capability, traffic radars, cameras, and other sensors, can provide a multitude of vehicular services and increase the cooperative perception of vehicles on the road, leading to increased road safety and traffic efficiency. Moreover, the central C-ITS system responsible for overseeing the road traffic and infrastructure, such as the RSUs, needs an efficient way of collecting and disseminating important information to road users. Warnings of accidents or other dangers, and other types of vehicular services like electronic toll collection (ETC), are examples of types of information that the central C-ITS system is responsible for disseminating. To support these issues, we present the design of an implemented roadside and cloud architecture for the support of C-ITS services. Having the main goals of managing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication units and network messages of a public authority or motorway operator, which functions as the central C-ITS system, the proposed architecture was developed for different mobility testbeds in Portugal, under the scope of the STEROID research project and the pan-European C-Roads initiative. RSUs, equipped with ETSI ITS-G5 communications, are deployed with a cellular link or fiber optics connection for remote control and configuration. These are connected to a cloud Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker where communications are based on a geographical tiling scheme, which allows the selection of the appropriate coverage areas to disseminate C-ITS messages. The architecture is deployed in the field, on different Portuguese motorways, with the road traffic and infrastructure being monitored through a C-ITS platform with visualization and event reporting features. The provided architecture is independent of the underlying communications technology, being easily adapted in the future to support Cellular-V2X (PC5 interface) or 5G RSUs. Results of the performance of the deployed architecture are provided.
